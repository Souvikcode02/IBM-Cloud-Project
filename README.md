A Capstone Project for IBM SkillsBuild for Academia
Domain: Agentic AI · Personalized Learning · IBM Cloud · AI Coaching

📌 Problem Statement
Many students struggle to choose the right learning paths aligned with their interests and long-term goals due to the overwhelming number of online courses and lack of personalized guidance.

LearMate aims to solve this by acting as an Agentic AI coach that interacts with students, understands their preferences (e.g., Frontend Development, Cybersecurity, UI/UX Design), assesses current skill levels, and dynamically builds a personalized, evolving course roadmap.

💡 Proposed Solution
We developed an AI-powered system that:

Understands student interests and skill levels.

Uses hybrid recommendation algorithms.

Dynamically adjusts learning paths based on real-time user behavior.

Leverages IBM Cloud and Agentic AI for scalable deployment.

⚙️ System Development Approach
1. 🧠 Data Collection
Collects data on user interests, goals, course metadata.

Tracks behavior like course completions and feedback.

2. 🧹 Data Processing
Cleans and preprocesses data.

Feature engineering (learning pace, topic preferences, etc.).

3. 🧾 Recommendation Logic
Hybrid: Content-based + Collaborative filtering.

Uses Agentic AI for dynamic adjustments.

4. 🗣️ AI Coaching Interface
Built with IBM Watson Assistant.

Provides real-time conversation, goal tracking, and suggestions.

5. ☁️ Deployment
Hosted on IBM Cloud Lite.

Uses AutoAI and Agentic AI Workbench.

Available via chatbot and web dashboard.

✅ Results
